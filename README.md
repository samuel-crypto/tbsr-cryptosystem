# tbsr-cryptosystem
A (breakable) cryptosystem based on [what this reddit post is suggesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/7tfkdw/could_you_use_language_as_a_very_strong_way_for/). The whole point of me setting up this respository is to approach cryptoanalysis publically (to be able to post all code that implements this cipher and all code that weakens its encryption).

# WARNING!
Please read the above carefully - this is not a cipher to be used for any sort of securing of any data, it is not semantically secure (to say the least).
